# Isaac-Character-Editor

Based on my old Isaac editor written in C#/WPF ([link][moddingofisaac.com/mod/16/isaaccharactereditor]),
Isaac Character Editor Rewritten 6.0 is going to be the old editor rewritten in C++/Qt to add native Mac/Linux support and hopefully provide a more stable experience because the old version is a mess.
